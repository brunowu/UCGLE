# UCGLE method (Unite and Conquer GMRES/LS-ERAM method)


This manuel comprises the source code, datasets, and build instructions that can be used to reproduce the results of our UCGLE method and GMRES_LS method, we explain how to compile, install and run our UGCLE method codes, all the results of this paper can be reproduced with the help of this description.

# Description

## Check-list


• Algorithm: UCGLE method and GMRES_LS method

• Program: C MPI codes

• Compilation: C compiler (gcc version 4.9.1 is tested) 

• Binary: MPI executable

• Data set: Public available matrix file from Matrix Market and generated matrix files

• Run-time environment: Linux OS (Redhat 6.3 is tested) and Mac OS X (higer than Mac OS X 10.9 are tested)

• Hardware: Any Intel CPU (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v2 @ 2.60GHz and Intel Core i7 @ 2.70GHZ are tested)

• Output: Execution time to solution and interation number

• Experiment workflow: Install PETSc and SLEPc, clone UCGLE codes, compile the codes, run the binary, observe the results

• Experiment customization: numberofGMRESMPIprocessors, number of Arnoldi MPI processors, standard parameters of GMRES
and Arnoldi, Least Square polynomial degree· · ·

• Publicly available?: Yes
